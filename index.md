### Learn to improve, improve to learn

Working on security improvement by design most of the time, so this place is a place to study some things and thought that is not relative to my job time, but help me to test, understand and increase my knowledge.

On some time, I also write stuff form my needs or for my wishes :)

[Roaster Code](https://github.com/roastercode) is a study place to make automated stuff with less as possible software layers.

Why use another language when BASH or Rust can make the just as fine as needed?

Reducing by the way the services layers of the system itself.

### BASH screwdriver for one machine to tuples data centers
