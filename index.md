### Learn to improve, improve to learn

Working on improvement by design most of the time, this place is to study some things and thoughts that is not relative to my job time, but help me to understand and increase my knowledge.

On some time, I also write stuff form my needs, for my wishes :)

[Roaster Code](https://github.com/roastercode) to make automated stuff with less as possible software layers.

Why use another language when BASH or Rust can make the job just as fine as needed?

Reducing by the way the services layers of the system itself.

### BASH screwdriver for one machine to tuples data centers

[M.A.A.S.](https://github.com/roastercode/MAAS/) Multiplexer Adaptive Administrator Solution to drive and maintain from simple environment to tuples of data centers around the world from one command line.

Purely written in BASH it is readable for your security, and flexible for your wishes.
